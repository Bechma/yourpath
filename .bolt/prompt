For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

I want you to use gluestack-ui library for components. If you can't use a component from gluestack-ui, tell me and put a placeholder comment for me so I can replace it later. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.
